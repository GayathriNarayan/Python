# Example
# This example opens a file, writes content in the, file and comes out gracefully because there is no problem at all −

try:
   fh = open("testfile", "w")
   fh.write("This is my test file for exception handling!!")
except IOError:
   print("Error: can\'t find file or read data")
else:
   print("Written content in the file successfully")
   fh.close()
