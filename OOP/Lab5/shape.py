# Create an abstract class Shape with abstract methods calculate_area and calculate_perimeter
# Create classes Circle (receives radius upon initialization) and Rectangle (receives height and width upon initialization) 
# that implement those methods (returning the result)
# And do the same thing as you did with the previous lab (Lab4). Seperate files for different classes.

#abstract class
# An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within 
# any child classes built from the abstract class. A class which contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class.
